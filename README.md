-Please do not fork from this repository.

-Everyone should make their own development branch:
    ~ dev/[your intended task]
    
-Download the zip file from your branch

-When you'd like to update your branch:
    ~ click the "Add File" > "Upload Files" buttons (on your branch)
    
-Once you've finished working on your branch and would like to update the master branch,

 you will need to create a pull request:
     ~ Menu at the top of the repo, will have a button "Pull Requests"
     ~ Click "Create New Pull Request"
     ~ set the "base" branch to the master branch, set the "compare" branch to your branch (the one you've created)
     ~ Then click "Create Pull Request"
     NOTE: Do **NOT** merge your branch / pull request into the master before it has been reviewed by the Environment Lead (Morgan)


Once this Repository has been tested, I should be able to transfer ownership to the Environment Lead (Morgan)

Will research whether we can all work concurrently.
